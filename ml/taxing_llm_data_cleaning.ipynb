      "taxes under GST, road to a harmonized system of indirect tax has been paved\n",
      "making India an economic union.\n",
      "2. CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN INDIA\n",
      "BEFORE GST :\n",
      "2.1 Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be levied\n",
      "or collected except by authority of law. As per Article 246 of the Constitution,\n",
      "Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws in respect of matters given in\n",
      "Union List (List I of the Seventh Schedule) and State Government has the\n",
      "exclusive jurisdiction to legislate on the matters containing in State List (List II of\n",
      "the Seventh Schedule). In respect of the matters contained in Concurrent List (List\n",
      "III of the Seventh Schedule), both the Central Government and State\n",
      "Governments have concurrent powers to legislate.\n",
      "2.2 Before advent of GST, the most important sources of indirect tax revenue\n",
      "for the Union were customs duty (entry 83 of Union List), central excise duty\n",
      "(entry 84 of Union List), and service tax (entry 97 of Union List). Although entry\n",
      "92C was inserted in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution by\n",
      "the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 for levy of taxes on\n",
      "services, it was not notified. So tax on services were continued to be levied under\n",
      "the residual entry, i.e. entry 97, of the Union List till GST came into force. The\n",
      "3 | 55Union also levied tax called Central Sales Tax (CST) on inter-State sale and\n",
      "purchase of goods and on inter-State consignments of goods by virtue of entry\n",
      "92A and 92B respectively. CST however is assigned to the State of origin, as per\n",
      "Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 made under Article 269 of the Constitution.\n",
      "2.3 On the State side, the most important sources of tax revenue were tax on\n",
      "sale and purchase (entry 54 of the State List), excise duty on alcoholic liquors,\n",
      "opium and narcotics (entry 51 of the State List), Taxes on luxuries,\n",
      "entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling (entry 62 of the State List),\n",
      "octroi or entry tax (entry 52 of the State List) and electricity tax ((entry 53 of the\n",
      "State List). CST was also an important source of revenue though the same was\n",
      "levied by the Union.\n",
      "3. HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN POST-\n",
      "INDEPENDENCE INDIA TILL GST:\n",
      "3.1 In post-Independence period, central excise duty was levied on a few\n",
      "commodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs,\n",
      "and consumer goods were outside the net by and large. The first set of reform was\n",
      "suggested by the Taxation Enquiry Commission (1953-54) under the\n",
      "chairmanship of Dr. John Matthai. The Commission recommended that sales tax\n",
      "should be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue with Union\n",
      "governments' intervention allowed generally only in case of inter-State sales. It\n",
      "also recommended levy of a tax on inter-State sales subject to a ceiling of 1%,\n",
      "which the States would administer and also retain the revenue.\n",
      "3.2 The power to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the course of inter-\n",
      "State trade and commerce was assigned to the Union by the Constitution (Sixth\n",
      "Amendment) Act, 1956. By mid-1970s, central excise duty was extended to most\n",
      "manufactured goods. Central excise duty was levied on unit, called specific duty,\n",
      "4 | 55and on value, called ad valorem duty. The number of rates was too many with no\n",
      "offsetting of taxes paid on inputs leading to significant cascading and\n",
      "classification disputes.\n",
      "3.3 The Indirect Taxation Enquiry Committee constituted in 1976 under Shri L\n",
      "K Jha recommended, inter alia, converting specific rates into ad valorem rates,\n",
      "rate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of value added tax at\n",
      "manufacturing level (MANVAT). In 1986, the recommendation of the Jha\n",
      "Committee on moving on to value added tax in manufacturing was partially\n",
      "implemented. This was called modified value added tax (MODVAT). In principle,\n",
      "duty was payable on value addition but in the beginning it was limited to select\n",
      "inputs and manufactured goods only with one-to-one correlation between input\n",
      "and manufactured goods for eligibility to take input tax credit. The comprehensive\n",
      "coverage of MODVAT was achieved by 1996-97.\n",
      "3.4 The next wave of reform in indirect tax sphere came with the New\n",
      "Economic Policy of 1991. The Tax Reforms Committee under the chairmanship\n",
      "of Prof. Raja J Chelliah was appointed in 1991. This Committee recommended\n",
      "broadening of the tax base by taxing services and pruning exemptions,\n",
      "consolidation and lowering of rates, extension of MODVAT on all inputs\n",
      "including capital goods. It suggested that reform of tax structure must have to be\n",
      "accompanied by a reform of tax administration, if complete benefits were to be\n",
      "derived from the tax reforms. Many of the recommendations of the Chelliah\n",
      "Committee were implemented. In 1999-2000, tax rates were merged in three rates,\n",
      "with additional rates on a few luxury goods. In 2000-01, three rates were merged\n",
      "into one rate called Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). A few commodities\n",
      "were subjected to special excise duty.\n",
      "3.5 Taxation of services by the Union was introduced in 1994 bringing in its\n",
      "5 | 55ambit only three services, namely general insurance, telecommunication and stock\n",
      "broking. Gradually, more and more services were brought into the fold. Over the\n",
      "next decade, more and more services were brought under the tax net. In 1994, tax\n",
      "rate on three services was 5% which gradually increased and in 2017 it was 15%\n",
      "(including cess). Before 2012, services were taxed under a ‘positive list’\n",
      "approach. This approach was prone to ‘tax avoidance’. In 2012 budget, negative\n",
      "list approach was adopted where 17 services were out of taxation net and all other\n",
      "services were subject to tax. In 2004, the input tax credit scheme for CENVAT\n",
      "and Service Tax was merged to permit cross utilization of credits across these\n",
      "taxes.\n",
      "3.6 Before state level VAT was introduced by States in the first half of the first\n",
      "decade of this century, sales tax was levied in States since independence. Sales tax\n",
      "was plagued by some serious flaws. It was levied by States in an uncoordinated\n",
      "manner the consequences of which were different rates of sales tax on different\n",
      "commodities in different States. Rates of sales tax were more than ten in some\n",
      "States and these varied for the same commodity in different States. Inter-state\n",
      "sales were subjected to levy of Central Sales Tax. As this tax was appropriated by\n",
      "the exporting State credit was not allowed by the dealer in the importing State.\n",
      "This resulted into exportation of tax from richer to poorer states and also\n",
      "cascading of taxes. Interestingly, States had power of taxation over services from\n",
      "the very beginning. States levied tax on advertisements, luxuries, entertainments,\n",
      "amusements, betting and gambling.\n",
      "3.7 A report, titled \"Reform of Domestic Trade Taxes in India\", on reforming\n",
      "indirect taxes, especially State sales tax, by National Institute of Public Finance\n",
      "and Policy under the leadership of Dr. Amaresh Bagchi, was prepared in 1994.\n",
      "This Report prepared the ground for implementation of VAT in States. Some of\n",
      "6 | 55the key recommendations were; replacing sales tax by VAT by moving over to a\n",
      "multistage system of taxation; allowing input tax credits for all inputs, including\n",
      "on machinery and equipment; harmonization and rationalization of tax rates\n",
      "across States with two or three rates within specified bands; pruning of\n",
      "exemptions and concessions except for a basic threshold limit and items like\n",
      "unprocessed food; zero rating of exports, inter-State sales and consignment\n",
      "transfers to registered dealers; taxing inter-State sales to non-registered persons as\n",
      "local sales; modernization of tax administration, computerization of operations\n",
      "and simplification of forms and procedures.\n",
      "3.8 The first preliminary discussion on transition from sales tax regime to VAT\n",
      "regime took place in a meeting of Chief Ministers convened by the Union Finance\n",
      "Minister in 1995. A standing Committee of State Finance Ministers was\n",
      "constituted, as a result of meeting of the Union Finance Ministers and Chief\n",
      "Ministers in November, 1999, to deliberate on the design of VAT which was later\n",
      "made the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). Haryana was\n",
      "the first State to implement VAT, in 2003. In 2005, VAT was implemented in\n",
      "most of the states. Uttar Pradesh was the last State to implement VAT, from 1st\n",
      "January, 2008.\n",
      "4. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON GST / VAT:\n",
      "4.1 VAT and GST are used inter-changeably as the latter denotes\n",
      "comprehensiveness of VAT by coverage of goods and services. France was the\n",
      "first country to implement VAT, in 1954. Presently, more than 160 countries have\n",
      "implemented GST / VAT in some form or the other. The most popular form of\n",
      "VAT is where taxes paid on inputs are allowed to be adjusted in the liability at the\n",
      "output. The VAT or GST regime in practice varies from one country to another in\n",
      "terms of its technical aspects like ‘definition of supply’, ‘extent of coverage of\n",
      "7 | 55goods and services’, ‘treatment of exemptions and zero rating’ etc. However, at a\n",
      "broader level, it has one common principle, it is a destination based consumption\n",
      "tax. From economic point of view, VAT is considered to be a superior system over\n",
      "sales tax of taxing consumption because the former is neutral in allocation of\n",
      "resources as it taxes value addition. Besides, there are certain distinct advantages\n",
      "of VAT. It is less cascading making the taxation system transparent and anti-\n",
      "inflationary. From revenue point of view, VAT leads to greater compliance\n",
      "because of creation of transaction trails.\n",
      "4.2 When compared globally, VAT structures are either overly centralized\n",
      "where tax is levied and administered by the Central government (Germany,\n",
      "Switzerland, Austria), or dual GST structure wherein both Centre and States\n",
      "administer tax independently (Canada) or with some co-ordination between the\n",
      "national and sub-national entities (Brazil, Russia). While a centralized structure\n",
      "reduces fiscal autonomy for the States, a decentralized structure enhances\n",
      "compliance burden for the taxpayers. Canada is a federal country with unique\n",
      "model of taxation in which certain provinces have joined federal GST and others\n",
      "have not. Provinces which administer their taxes separately are called ‘non-\n",
      "participating provinces’, whereas provinces which have teamed up with the Federal\n",
      "Government for tax administration are called ‘participating provinces’.\n",
      "4.3 The rate of GST varies across countries. While Malaysia has a lower rate of\n",
      "6% (Malaysia though scrapped GST in 2018 due to popular uproar against it),\n",
      "Hungary has one of the highest rate of 27%. Australia levies GST at the rate of\n",
      "10% whereas Canada has multiple rate slabs. The average rate of VAT across the\n",
      "EU is around 19.5%.\n",
      "8 | 555. NEED FOR GST IN INDIA:\n",
      "5.1 The introduction of CENVAT removed to a great extent cascading burden\n",
      "by expanding the coverage of credit for all inputs, including capital goods.\n",
      "CENVAT scheme later also allowed credit of services and the basket of inputs,\n",
      "capital goods and input services could be used for payment of both central excise\n",
      "duty and service tax. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the States has removed\n",
      "the cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as well as tax paid on\n",
      "previous purchases and has again been an improvement over the previous sales tax\n",
      "regime.\n",
      "5.2 But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. The\n",
      "incompleteness in CENVAT is that it has yet not been extended to include chain of\n",
      "value addition in the distributive trade below the stage of production. Similarly, in\n",
      "the State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been removed and\n",
      "the cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained unrelieved. Moreover,\n",
      "there are several taxes in the States, such as, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc.\n",
      "which have still not been subsumed in the VAT. Further, there has also not been\n",
      "any integration of VAT on goods with tax on services at the State level with\n",
      "removal of cascading effect of service tax.\n",
      "5.3 CST was another source of distortion in terms of its cascading nature. It was\n",
      "also against one of the basic principles of consumption taxes that tax should accrue\n",
      "to the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. Despite remarkable\n",
      "harmonization in VAT regimes under the auspices of the EC, the national market\n",
      "was fragmented with too many obstacles in free movement of goods necessitated\n",
      "by procedural requirement under VAT and CST.\n",
      "9 | 555.4 In the constitutional scheme, taxation powers on goods was with Central\n",
      "Government but it was limited up to the stage of manufacture and production while\n",
      "States have powers to tax sale and purchase of goods. Centre had powers to tax\n",
      "services and States also had powers to tax certain services specified in clause\n",
      "(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution. This sort of division of taxing powers\n",
      "created a grey zone which led to legal disputes. Determination of what constitutes\n",
      "a goods or service is difficult because in modern complex system of production, a\n",
      "product is normally a mixture of goods and services.\n",
      "5.5 As can be seen from the previous paragraphs, India moved towards value\n",
      "added taxation both at Central and State level, and this process was complete by\n",
      "2005. Integration of Central VAT and State VAT therefore is nothing but an\n",
      "inevitable consequence of the reform process. The Constitution of India envisages\n",
      "a federal nature of power bestowed upon both Union and States in the Constitution\n",
      "itself. As a natural corollary of this, any unification of the taxation system required\n",
      "a dual GST, levied and collected both by the Union and the States.\n",
      "6. GST : A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:\n",
      "6.1 The Kelkar Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management\n",

      "7. CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING GST:\n",
      "7.1 In the discussion that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST,\n",
      "there were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement\n",
      "between Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform\n",
      "as vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of\n",
      "interests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of the challenging issues,\n",
      "addressed in the run up to GST, were the following:\n",
      "7.2 Origin-based versus Destination-based taxation: GST is a destination based\n",
      "consumption tax. Under destination based taxation, tax accrues to the destination\n",
      "place where consumption of the goods or services takes place. The existing VAT\n",
      "regime was based on origin principle where Central Sales Tax was assigned to the\n",
      "State of origin where production or sale happened and not to the State where\n",
      "consumption happened. Many manufacturing States expressed concerns over the\n",
      "loss of revenue on account of shift from origin based taxation to destination based\n",
      "taxation.\n",
      "12 | 557.2.1 An argument put forward on behalf of producing states in support of origin\n",
      "based taxation is that they need to collect at least some tax from inter-State sales in\n",
      "order to recover the cost of infrastructure and public services provided by the State\n",
      "Governments to the industries producing the goods which are consumed in other\n",
      "states. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that in the absence of a tax\n",
      "on inter-State sales, the location of export industries within their jurisdiction would\n",
      "not contribute to the tax revenues of the exporting state. This view was missing the\n",
      "fact that any value addition in a jurisdiction necessarily means extra income in the\n",
      "hands of the residents of that jurisdiction. Spending of this income on consumer\n",
      "goods expands the sales tax base of the producing states and thereby contributes to\n",
      "their revenues. In fact, to the extent that consumer expenditures are dependent on\n",
      "the level of income of the residents of a State, it is the producing States that stand\n",
      "to gain the most in additional sales tax revenues (even under the destination basis\n",
      "of consumption taxes) from increased export output.\n",
      "7.3 Rate Structure and Compensation: There was uncertainty about gains in\n",
      "revenue after implementation of GST. Though attempts were made to estimate a\n",
      "revenue neutral rate, nonetheless it remains an estimate only. It was difficult to\n",
      "estimate accurately as to how much the States will gain from tax on services and\n",
      "how much they will lose on account of removal of cascading effect and phasing\n",
      "out of CST. In view of this, States asked for compensation during the first five\n",
      "years of implementation of GST.\n",
      "7.3.1 A Committee headed by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind\n",
      "Subramanian on possible tax rates under GST suggested RNR (Revenue Neutral\n",
      "Rate). The term RNR refers to that single rate, which preserves revenue at desired\n",
      "(current) levels. This would differ from the standard rate, which is the rate that\n",
      "would apply to a majority of goods and services. In practice, there will be a\n",
      "13 | 55structure of rates, but for the sake of analytical clarity and precision it is\n",
      "appropriate to think of the RNR as a single rate. It is a given single rate that gets\n",
      "converted into a whole rate structure, depending on policy choices about\n",
      "exemptions, what commodities to charge at a lower rate and what to charge at a\n",
      "very high rate.\n",
      "7.3.2 The Committee recommended RNR of 15-15.5% (to be levied by the Centre\n",
      "and States combined). The lower rates (to be applied to certain goods consumed by\n",
      "the poor) should be 12%. Further, the sin or demerit rates (to be applied on luxury\n",
      "cars, aerated beverages, pan masala, and tobacco) should be 40%.\n",
      "7.4 Dispute Settlement: A harmonized system of taxation necessarily required\n",
      "that all stakeholders stick to the decisions taken by the supreme body, which was\n",
      "later constituted as the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council). However,\n",
      "the possibility of departure from the recommendations of such body cannot be\n",
      "completely ruled out. Any departure would definitely affect other stakeholders and\n",
      "in such circumstances there must be a statutory body to which affected parties may\n",
      "approach for dispute resolution. The nature of such dispute resolution body was a\n",
      "bone of contention. Under the Constitution (One Hundred Fifteenth Amendment)\n",
      "Bill, 2011, a Goods and Services Tax Dispute Settlement Authority was to be\n",
      "constituted for this purpose. This body was judicial in nature. The proposed\n",
      "constitution of this Authority was challenged because its powers would override\n",
      "the supremacy of the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Constitution (One\n",
      "Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 departed from the previous GST\n",
      "amendment bill and proposed that the Goods and Services Tax Council may decide\n",
      "about the modalities to resolve disputes arising out of its recommendations.\n",
      "14 | 557.5 Alcohol and Petroleum products: Alcoholic liquor for human consumption\n",
      "and petroleum products are major contributor to revenue of States. As States were\n",
      "uncertain about impact of GST on their finances and moreover loss of autonomy in\n",
      "collection of tax revenue, States unanimously argued for exclusion of these\n",
      "products from the ambit of GST. In the 115th Amendment Bill alcoholic liquor for\n",
      "human consumption and five petroleum products namely crude petroleum, high\n",
      "speed diesel, motor spirit or petrol, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas were kept\n",
      "out of GST. But in the 122nd Amendment Bill, only alcoholic liquor for human\n",
      "consumption was kept outside GST and above mentioned five petroleum products\n",
      "were proposed to be brought under GST from a date to be recommended by the\n",
      "Council. The Central Government has also retained its power to tax tobacco and\n",
      "tobacco products, though these are also under GST. Thus, to ensure smooth\n",
      "transition and provide fiscal buffer to States, it was agreed to keep alcohol\n",
      "completely out of the ambit of GST.\n",
      "8. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:\n",
      "8.1 As explained above, unification of Central VAT and State VAT was\n",
      "possible in form of a dual levy under the constitutional scheme. Power of taxation\n",
      "is assigned to either Union or States subject-wise under Schedule VII of the\n",
      "Constitution. While the Centre is empowered to tax goods up to the production or\n",
      "manufacturing stage, the States have the power to tax goods at distribution stage.\n",
      "The Union can tax services using residuary powers but States could not. Under a\n",
      "unified Goods and Services Tax scheme, both should have power to tax the\n",
      "complete supply chain from production to distribution, and both goods and\n",
      "services. The scheme of the Constitution did not provide for any concurrent taxing\n",
      "powers to the Union as well as the States and for the purpose of introducing goods\n",
      "and services tax amendment of the Constitution conferring simultaneous power on\n",
      "15 | 55Parliament as well as the State Legislatures to make laws for levying goods and\n",

      "2. CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN INDIA\n",
      "BEFORE GST :\n",
      "2.1 Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be levied\n",
      "or collected except by authority of law. As per Article 246 of the Constitution,\n",
      "Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws in respect of matters given in\n",
      "Union List (List I of the Seventh Schedule) and State Government has the\n",
      "exclusive jurisdiction to legislate on the matters containing in State List (List II of\n",
      "the Seventh Schedule). In respect of the matters contained in Concurrent List (List\n",
      "III of the Seventh Schedule), both the Central Government and State\n",
      "Governments have concurrent powers to legislate.\n",
      "2.2 Before advent of GST, the most important sources of indirect tax revenue\n",
      "for the Union were customs duty (entry 83 of Union List), central excise duty\n",
      "(entry 84 of Union List), and service tax (entry 97 of Union List). Although entry\n",
      "92C was inserted in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution by\n",
      "the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 for levy of taxes on\n",
      "services, it was not notified. So tax on services were continued to be levied under\n",
      "the residual entry, i.e. entry 97, of the Union List till GST came into force. The\n",
      "Union also levied tax called Central Sales Tax (CST) on inter-State sale and\n",
      "purchase of goods and on inter-State consignments of goods by virtue of entry\n",
      "92A and 92B respectively. CST however is assigned to the State of origin, as per\n",
      "Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 made under Article 269 of the Constitution.\n",
      "2.3 On the State side, the most important sources of tax revenue were tax on\n",
      "sale and purchase (entry 54 of the State List), excise duty on alcoholic liquors,\n",
      "opium and narcotics (entry 51 of the State List), Taxes on luxuries,\n",
      "entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling (entry 62 of the State List),\n",
      "octroi or entry tax (entry 52 of the State List) and electricity tax ((entry 53 of the\n",
      "State List). CST was also an important source of revenue though the same was\n",
      "levied by the Union.\n",
      "3. HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN POST-\n",
      "INDEPENDENCE INDIA TILL GST:\n",
      "3.1 In post-Independence period, central excise duty was levied on a few\n",
      "commodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs,\n",
      "and consumer goods were outside the net by and large. The first set of reform was\n",
      "suggested by the Taxation Enquiry Commission (1953-54) under the\n",
      "chairmanship of Dr. John Matthai. The Commission recommended that sales tax\n",
      "should be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue with Union\n",
      "governments' intervention allowed generally only in case of inter-State sales. It\n",
      "also recommended levy of a tax on inter-State sales subject to a ceiling of 1%,\n",
      "which the States would administer and also retain the revenue.\n",
      "3.2 The power to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the course of inter-\n",
      "State trade and commerce was assigned to the Union by the Constitution (Sixth\n",
      "Amendment) Act, 1956. By mid-1970s, central excise duty was extended to most\n",
      "manufactured goods. Central excise duty was levied on unit, called specific duty,\n",
      "and on value, called ad valorem duty. The number of rates was too many with no\n",
      "offsetting of taxes paid on inputs leading to significant cascading and\n",
      "classification disputes.\n",
      "3.3 The Indirect Taxation Enquiry Committee constituted in 1976 under Shri L\n",
      "K Jha recommended, inter alia, converting specific rates into ad valorem rates,\n",
      "rate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of value added tax at\n",
      "manufacturing level (MANVAT). In 1986, the recommendation of the Jha\n",
      "Committee on moving on to value added tax in manufacturing was partially\n",
      "implemented. This was called modified value added tax (MODVAT). In principle,\n",
      "duty was payable on value addition but in the beginning it was limited to select\n",
      "inputs and manufactured goods only with one-to-one correlation between input\n",
      "and manufactured goods for eligibility to take input tax credit. The comprehensive\n",
      "coverage of MODVAT was achieved by 1996-97.\n",
      "3.4 The next wave of reform in indirect tax sphere came with the New\n",
      "Economic Policy of 1991. The Tax Reforms Committee under the chairmanship\n",
      "of Prof. Raja J Chelliah was appointed in 1991. This Committee recommended\n",
      "broadening of the tax base by taxing services and pruning exemptions,\n",
      "consolidation and lowering of rates, extension of MODVAT on all inputs\n",
      "including capital goods. It suggested that reform of tax structure must have to be\n",
      "accompanied by a reform of tax administration, if complete benefits were to be\n",
      "derived from the tax reforms. Many of the recommendations of the Chelliah\n",
      "Committee were implemented. In 1999-2000, tax rates were merged in three rates,\n",
      "with additional rates on a few luxury goods. In 2000-01, three rates were merged\n",
      "into one rate called Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). A few commodities\n",
      "were subjected to special excise duty.\n",
      "3.5 Taxation of services by the Union was introduced in 1994 bringing in its\n",
      "ambit only three services, namely general insurance, telecommunication and stock\n",
      "broking. Gradually, more and more services were brought into the fold. Over the\n",
      "next decade, more and more services were brought under the tax net. In 1994, tax\n",
      "rate on three services was 5% which gradually increased and in 2017 it was 15%\n",
      "(including cess). Before 2012, services were taxed under a ‘positive list’\n",
      "approach. This approach was prone to ‘tax avoidance’. In 2012 budget, negative\n",
      "list approach was adopted where 17 services were out of taxation net and all other\n",
      "services were subject to tax. In 2004, the input tax credit scheme for CENVAT\n",
      "and Service Tax was merged to permit cross utilization of credits across these\n",
      "taxes.\n",
      "3.6 Before state level VAT was introduced by States in the first half of the first\n",
      "decade of this century, sales tax was levied in States since independence. Sales tax\n",
      "was plagued by some serious flaws. It was levied by States in an uncoordinated\n",
      "manner the consequences of which were different rates of sales tax on different\n",
      "commodities in different States. Rates of sales tax were more than ten in some\n",
      "States and these varied for the same commodity in different States. Inter-state\n",
      "sales were subjected to levy of Central Sales Tax. As this tax was appropriated by\n",
      "the exporting State credit was not allowed by the dealer in the importing State.\n",
      "This resulted into exportation of tax from richer to poorer states and also\n",
      "cascading of taxes. Interestingly, States had power of taxation over services from\n",
      "the very beginning. States levied tax on advertisements, luxuries, entertainments,\n",

      "the key recommendations were; replacing sales tax by VAT by moving over to a\n",
      "multistage system of taxation; allowing input tax credits for all inputs, including\n",

      "the first State to implement VAT, in 2003. In 2005, VAT was implemented in\n",
      "most of the states. Uttar Pradesh was the last State to implement VAT, from 1st\n",
      "January, 2008.\n",
      "4. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON GST / VAT:\n",
      "4.1 VAT and GST are used inter-changeably as the latter denotes\n",
      "comprehensiveness of VAT by coverage of goods and services. France was the\n",
      "first country to implement VAT, in 1954. Presently, more than 160 countries have\n",
      "implemented GST / VAT in some form or the other. The most popular form of\n",
      "VAT is where taxes paid on inputs are allowed to be adjusted in the liability at the\n",
      "output. The VAT or GST regime in practice varies from one country to another in\n",
      "terms of its technical aspects like ‘definition of supply’, ‘extent of coverage of\n",
      "goods and services’, ‘treatment of exemptions and zero rating’ etc. However, at a\n",
      "broader level, it has one common principle, it is a destination based consumption\n",
      "tax. From economic point of view, VAT is considered to be a superior system over\n",
      "sales tax of taxing consumption because the former is neutral in allocation of\n",
      "resources as it taxes value addition. Besides, there are certain distinct advantages\n",
      "of VAT. It is less cascading making the taxation system transparent and anti-\n",
      "inflationary. From revenue point of view, VAT leads to greater compliance\n",
      "because of creation of transaction trails.\n",
      "4.2 When compared globally, VAT structures are either overly centralized\n",
      "where tax is levied and administered by the Central government (Germany,\n",
      "Switzerland, Austria), or dual GST structure wherein both Centre and States\n",
      "administer tax independently (Canada) or with some co-ordination between the\n",
      "national and sub-national entities (Brazil, Russia). While a centralized structure\n",
      "reduces fiscal autonomy for the States, a decentralized structure enhances\n",
      "compliance burden for the taxpayers. Canada is a federal country with unique\n",
      "model of taxation in which certain provinces have joined federal GST and others\n",
      "have not. Provinces which administer their taxes separately are called ‘non-\n",
      "participating provinces’, whereas provinces which have teamed up with the Federal\n",
      "Government for tax administration are called ‘participating provinces’.\n",
      "4.3 The rate of GST varies across countries. While Malaysia has a lower rate of\n",
      "6% (Malaysia though scrapped GST in 2018 due to popular uproar against it),\n",
      "Hungary has one of the highest rate of 27%. Australia levies GST at the rate of\n",
      "10% whereas Canada has multiple rate slabs. The average rate of VAT across the\n",
      "EU is around 19.5%.\n",
      "5. NEED FOR GST IN INDIA:\n",
      "5.1 The introduction of CENVAT removed to a great extent cascading burden\n",
      "by expanding the coverage of credit for all inputs, including capital goods.\n",
      "CENVAT scheme later also allowed credit of services and the basket of inputs,\n",
      "capital goods and input services could be used for payment of both central excise\n",
      "duty and service tax. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the States has removed\n",
      "the cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as well as tax paid on\n",
      "previous purchases and has again been an improvement over the previous sales tax\n",
      "regime.\n",
      "5.2 But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. The\n",
      "incompleteness in CENVAT is that it has yet not been extended to include chain of\n",
      "value addition in the distributive trade below the stage of production. Similarly, in\n",
      "the State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been removed and\n",
      "the cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained unrelieved. Moreover,\n",
      "there are several taxes in the States, such as, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc.\n",
      "which have still not been subsumed in the VAT. Further, there has also not been\n",
      "any integration of VAT on goods with tax on services at the State level with\n",
      "removal of cascading effect of service tax.\n",
      "5.3 CST was another source of distortion in terms of its cascading nature. It was\n",
      "also against one of the basic principles of consumption taxes that tax should accrue\n",
      "to the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. Despite remarkable\n",
      "harmonization in VAT regimes under the auspices of the EC, the national market\n",
      "was fragmented with too many obstacles in free movement of goods necessitated\n",
      "by procedural requirement under VAT and CST.\n",
      "5.4 In the constitutional scheme, taxation powers on goods was with Central\n",
      "Government but it was limited up to the stage of manufacture and production while\n",
      "States have powers to tax sale and purchase of goods. Centre had powers to tax\n",
      "services and States also had powers to tax certain services specified in clause\n",
      "(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution. This sort of division of taxing powers\n",
      "created a grey zone which led to legal disputes. Determination of what constitutes\n",
      "a goods or service is difficult because in modern complex system of production, a\n",
      "product is normally a mixture of goods and services.\n",
      "5.5 As can be seen from the previous paragraphs, India moved towards value\n",
      "added taxation both at Central and State level, and this process was complete by\n",
      "2005. Integration of Central VAT and State VAT therefore is nothing but an\n",
      "inevitable consequence of the reform process. The Constitution of India envisages\n",
      "a federal nature of power bestowed upon both Union and States in the Constitution\n",
      "itself. As a natural corollary of this, any unification of the taxation system required\n",
      "a dual GST, levied and collected both by the Union and the States.\n",
      "6. GST : A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:\n",
      "6.1 The Kelkar Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management\n",
      "(FRBM) recommended in 2005 introduction of a comprehensive tax on all goods\n",

      "Department of Revenue of Union Finance Ministry and all Finance Secretaries of\n",
      "the States as its members. This Joint Working Group got itself divided into three\n",

      "proposed GST and has formed the basis for discussion between the Centre and the\n",
      "States.\n",
      "7. CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING GST:\n",
      "7.1 In the discussion that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST,\n",
      "there were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement\n",
      "between Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform\n",
      "as vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of\n",
      "interests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of the challenging issues,\n",
      "addressed in the run up to GST, were the following:\n",
      "7.2 Origin-based versus Destination-based taxation: GST is a destination based\n",
      "consumption tax. Under destination based taxation, tax accrues to the destination\n",
      "place where consumption of the goods or services takes place. The existing VAT\n",
      "regime was based on origin principle where Central Sales Tax was assigned to the\n",
      "State of origin where production or sale happened and not to the State where\n",
      "consumption happened. Many manufacturing States expressed concerns over the\n",
      "loss of revenue on account of shift from origin based taxation to destination based\n",
      "taxation.\n",
      "7.2.1 An argument put forward on behalf of producing states in support of origin\n",
      "based taxation is that they need to collect at least some tax from inter-State sales in\n",
      "order to recover the cost of infrastructure and public services provided by the State\n",
      "Governments to the industries producing the goods which are consumed in other\n",
      "states. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that in the absence of a tax\n",
      "on inter-State sales, the location of export industries within their jurisdiction would\n",
      "not contribute to the tax revenues of the exporting state. This view was missing the\n",
      "fact that any value addition in a jurisdiction necessarily means extra income in the\n",
      "hands of the residents of that jurisdiction. Spending of this income on consumer\n",
      "goods expands the sales tax base of the producing states and thereby contributes to\n",
      "their revenues. In fact, to the extent that consumer expenditures are dependent on\n",
      "the level of income of the residents of a State, it is the producing States that stand\n",
      "to gain the most in additional sales tax revenues (even under the destination basis\n",
      "of consumption taxes) from increased export output.\n",
      "7.3 Rate Structure and Compensation: There was uncertainty about gains in\n",
      "revenue after implementation of GST. Though attempts were made to estimate a\n",
      "revenue neutral rate, nonetheless it remains an estimate only. It was difficult to\n",
      "estimate accurately as to how much the States will gain from tax on services and\n",
      "how much they will lose on account of removal of cascading effect and phasing\n",
      "out of CST. In view of this, States asked for compensation during the first five\n",
      "years of implementation of GST.\n",
      "7.3.1 A Committee headed by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind\n",
      "Subramanian on possible tax rates under GST suggested RNR (Revenue Neutral\n",
      "Rate). The term RNR refers to that single rate, which preserves revenue at desired\n",
      "(current) levels. This would differ from the standard rate, which is the rate that\n",
      "would apply to a majority of goods and services. In practice, there will be a\n",
      "structure of rates, but for the sake of analytical clarity and precision it is\n",
      "appropriate to think of the RNR as a single rate. It is a given single rate that gets\n",
      "converted into a whole rate structure, depending on policy choices about\n",
      "exemptions, what commodities to charge at a lower rate and what to charge at a\n",
      "very high rate.\n",
      "7.3.2 The Committee recommended RNR of 15-15.5% (to be levied by the Centre\n",
      "and States combined). The lower rates (to be applied to certain goods consumed by\n",
      "the poor) should be 12%. Further, the sin or demerit rates (to be applied on luxury\n",
      "cars, aerated beverages, pan masala, and tobacco) should be 40%.\n",
      "7.4 Dispute Settlement: A harmonized system of taxation necessarily required\n",
      "that all stakeholders stick to the decisions taken by the supreme body, which was\n",
      "later constituted as the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council). However,\n",
      "the possibility of departure from the recommendations of such body cannot be\n",
      "completely ruled out. Any departure would definitely affect other stakeholders and\n",
      "in such circumstances there must be a statutory body to which affected parties may\n",
      "approach for dispute resolution. The nature of such dispute resolution body was a\n",
      "bone of contention. Under the Constitution (One Hundred Fifteenth Amendment)\n",
      "Bill, 2011, a Goods and Services Tax Dispute Settlement Authority was to be\n",
      "constituted for this purpose. This body was judicial in nature. The proposed\n",
      "constitution of this Authority was challenged because its powers would override\n",
      "the supremacy of the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Constitution (One\n",
      "Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 departed from the previous GST\n",
      "amendment bill and proposed that the Goods and Services Tax Council may decide\n",
      "about the modalities to resolve disputes arising out of its recommendations.\n",
      "7.5 Alcohol and Petroleum products: Alcoholic liquor for human consumption\n",
      "and petroleum products are major contributor to revenue of States. As States were\n",
      "uncertain about impact of GST on their finances and moreover loss of autonomy in\n",
      "collection of tax revenue, States unanimously argued for exclusion of these\n",
      "products from the ambit of GST. In the 115th Amendment Bill alcoholic liquor for\n",
      "human consumption and five petroleum products namely crude petroleum, high\n",
      "speed diesel, motor spirit or petrol, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas were kept\n",
      "out of GST. But in the 122nd Amendment Bill, only alcoholic liquor for human\n",
      "consumption was kept outside GST and above mentioned five petroleum products\n",
      "were proposed to be brought under GST from a date to be recommended by the\n",
      "Council. The Central Government has also retained its power to tax tobacco and\n",
      "tobacco products, though these are also under GST. Thus, to ensure smooth\n",
      "transition and provide fiscal buffer to States, it was agreed to keep alcohol\n",
      "completely out of the ambit of GST.\n",
      "8. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:\n",
      "8.1 As explained above, unification of Central VAT and State VAT was\n",
      "possible in form of a dual levy under the constitutional scheme. Power of taxation\n",
      "is assigned to either Union or States subject-wise under Schedule VII of the\n",
      "Constitution. While the Centre is empowered to tax goods up to the production or\n",
      "manufacturing stage, the States have the power to tax goods at distribution stage.\n",
      "The Union can tax services using residuary powers but States could not. Under a\n",
      "unified Goods and Services Tax scheme, both should have power to tax the\n",
      "complete supply chain from production to distribution, and both goods and\n",
      "services. The scheme of the Constitution did not provide for any concurrent taxing\n",

      "e) Article 271 has been amended which restricts power of the Parliament to\n",

      "Centre as well as the States on a common base, i.e. supply of goods or services or\n",

      "4. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON GST / VAT:\n",
      "4.1 VAT and GST are used inter-changeably as the latter denotes\n",
      "comprehensiveness of VAT by coverage of goods and services. France was the\n",
      "first country to implement VAT, in 1954. Presently, more than 160 countries have\n",
      "implemented GST / VAT in some form or the other. The most popular form of\n",
      "VAT is where taxes paid on inputs are allowed to be adjusted in the liability at the\n",
      "output. The VAT or GST regime in practice varies from one country to another in\n",
      "terms of its technical aspects like ‘definition of supply’, ‘extent of coverage of\n",
      "goods and services’, ‘treatment of exemptions and zero rating’ etc. However, at a\n",
      "broader level, it has one common principle, it is a destination based consumption\n",
      "tax. From economic point of view, VAT is considered to be a superior system over\n",
      "sales tax of taxing consumption because the former is neutral in allocation of\n",
      "resources as it taxes value addition. Besides, there are certain distinct advantages\n",
      "of VAT. It is less cascading making the taxation system transparent and anti-\n",
      "inflationary. From revenue point of view, VAT leads to greater compliance\n",
      "because of creation of transaction trails.\n",
      "4.2 When compared globally, VAT structures are either overly centralized\n",
      "where tax is levied and administered by the Central government (Germany,\n",
      "Switzerland, Austria), or dual GST structure wherein both Centre and States\n",
      "administer tax independently (Canada) or with some co-ordination between the\n",
      "national and sub-national entities (Brazil, Russia). While a centralized structure\n",
      "reduces fiscal autonomy for the States, a decentralized structure enhances\n",
      "compliance burden for the taxpayers. Canada is a federal country with unique\n",
      "model of taxation in which certain provinces have joined federal GST and others\n",

      "5. NEED FOR GST IN INDIA:\n",
      "5.1 The introduction of CENVAT removed to a great extent cascading burden\n",
      "by expanding the coverage of credit for all inputs, including capital goods.\n",
      "CENVAT scheme later also allowed credit of services and the basket of inputs,\n",
      "capital goods and input services could be used for payment of both central excise\n",
      "duty and service tax. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the States has removed\n",
      "the cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as well as tax paid on\n",
      "previous purchases and has again been an improvement over the previous sales tax\n",
      "regime.\n",
      "5.2 But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. The\n",
      "incompleteness in CENVAT is that it has yet not been extended to include chain of\n",
      "value addition in the distributive trade below the stage of production. Similarly, in\n",
      "the State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been removed and\n",
      "the cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained unrelieved. Moreover,\n",
      "there are several taxes in the States, such as, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc.\n",
      "which have still not been subsumed in the VAT. Further, there has also not been\n",
      "any integration of VAT on goods with tax on services at the State level with\n",
      "removal of cascading effect of service tax.\n",
      "5.3 CST was another source of distortion in terms of its cascading nature. It was\n",
      "also against one of the basic principles of consumption taxes that tax should accrue\n",
      "to the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. Despite remarkable\n",
      "harmonization in VAT regimes under the auspices of the EC, the national market\n",
      "was fragmented with too many obstacles in free movement of goods necessitated\n",

      "7. CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING GST:\n",
      "7.1 In the discussion that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST,\n",
      "there were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement\n",
      "between Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform\n",
      "as vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of\n",
      "interests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of the challenging issues,\n",
      "addressed in the run up to GST, were the following:\n",
      "7.2 Origin-based versus Destination-based taxation: GST is a destination based\n",
      "consumption tax. Under destination based taxation, tax accrues to the destination\n",
      "place where consumption of the goods or services takes place. The existing VAT\n",
      "regime was based on origin principle where Central Sales Tax was assigned to the\n",
      "State of origin where production or sale happened and not to the State where\n",
      "consumption happened. Many manufacturing States expressed concerns over the\n",
      "loss of revenue on account of shift from origin based taxation to destination based\n",
      "taxation.\n",
      "7.2.1 An argument put forward on behalf of producing states in support of origin\n",
      "based taxation is that they need to collect at least some tax from inter-State sales in\n",
      "order to recover the cost of infrastructure and public services provided by the State\n",
      "Governments to the industries producing the goods which are consumed in other\n",
      "states. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that in the absence of a tax\n",
      "on inter-State sales, the location of export industries within their jurisdiction would\n",
      "not contribute to the tax revenues of the exporting state. This view was missing the\n",
      "fact that any value addition in a jurisdiction necessarily means extra income in the\n",
      "hands of the residents of that jurisdiction. Spending of this income on consumer\n",
      "goods expands the sales tax base of the producing states and thereby contributes to\n",
      "their revenues. In fact, to the extent that consumer expenditures are dependent on\n",
      "the level of income of the residents of a State, it is the producing States that stand\n",
      "to gain the most in additional sales tax revenues (even under the destination basis\n",
      "of consumption taxes) from increased export output.\n",
      "7.3 Rate Structure and Compensation: There was uncertainty about gains in\n",
      "revenue after implementation of GST. Though attempts were made to estimate a\n",
      "revenue neutral rate, nonetheless it remains an estimate only. It was difficult to\n",
      "estimate accurately as to how much the States will gain from tax on services and\n",
      "how much they will lose on account of removal of cascading effect and phasing\n",
      "out of CST. In view of this, States asked for compensation during the first five\n",
      "years of implementation of GST.\n",
      "7.3.1 A Committee headed by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind\n",
      "Subramanian on possible tax rates under GST suggested RNR (Revenue Neutral\n",
      "Rate). The term RNR refers to that single rate, which preserves revenue at desired\n",
      "(current) levels. This would differ from the standard rate, which is the rate that\n",
      "would apply to a majority of goods and services. In practice, there will be a\n",
      "structure of rates, but for the sake of analytical clarity and precision it is\n",
      "appropriate to think of the RNR as a single rate. It is a given single rate that gets\n",
      "converted into a whole rate structure, depending on policy choices about\n",
      "exemptions, what commodities to charge at a lower rate and what to charge at a\n",
      "very high rate.\n",
      "7.3.2 The Committee recommended RNR of 15-15.5% (to be levied by the Centre\n",
      "and States combined). The lower rates (to be applied to certain goods consumed by\n",
      "the poor) should be 12%. Further, the sin or demerit rates (to be applied on luxury\n",
      "cars, aerated beverages, pan masala, and tobacco) should be 40%.\n",
      "7.4 Dispute Settlement: A harmonized system of taxation necessarily required\n",
      "that all stakeholders stick to the decisions taken by the supreme body, which was\n",
      "later constituted as the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council). However,\n",
      "the possibility of departure from the recommendations of such body cannot be\n",
      "completely ruled out. Any departure would definitely affect other stakeholders and\n",
      "in such circumstances there must be a statutory body to which affected parties may\n",
      "approach for dispute resolution. The nature of such dispute resolution body was a\n",
      "bone of contention. Under the Constitution (One Hundred Fifteenth Amendment)\n",
      "Bill, 2011, a Goods and Services Tax Dispute Settlement Authority was to be\n",
      "constituted for this purpose. This body was judicial in nature. The proposed\n",
      "constitution of this Authority was challenged because its powers would override\n",
      "the supremacy of the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Constitution (One\n",
      "Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 departed from the previous GST\n",
      "amendment bill and proposed that the Goods and Services Tax Council may decide\n",
      "about the modalities to resolve disputes arising out of its recommendations.\n",
      "7.5 Alcohol and Petroleum products: Alcoholic liquor for human consumption\n",
      "and petroleum products are major contributor to revenue of States. As States were\n",
      "uncertain about impact of GST on their finances and moreover loss of autonomy in\n",
      "collection of tax revenue, States unanimously argued for exclusion of these\n",
      "products from the ambit of GST. In the 115th Amendment Bill alcoholic liquor for\n",
      "human consumption and five petroleum products namely crude petroleum, high\n",
      "speed diesel, motor spirit or petrol, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas were kept\n",
      "out of GST. But in the 122nd Amendment Bill, only alcoholic liquor for human\n",
      "consumption was kept outside GST and above mentioned five petroleum products\n",
      "were proposed to be brought under GST from a date to be recommended by the\n",
      "Council. The Central Government has also retained its power to tax tobacco and\n",
      "tobacco products, though these are also under GST. Thus, to ensure smooth\n",
      "transition and provide fiscal buffer to States, it was agreed to keep alcohol\n",
      "completely out of the ambit of GST.\n",
      "8. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:\n",
      "8.1 As explained above, unification of Central VAT and State VAT was\n",
      "possible in form of a dual levy under the constitutional scheme. Power of taxation\n",
      "is assigned to either Union or States subject-wise under Schedule VII of the\n",

      "Centre as well as the States on a common base, i.e. supply of goods or services or\n",

      "SGST). State GST (State Tax / SGST) would be called UTGST (Union territory\n",
      "tax) in Union Territories without legislature. CGST & SGST / UTGST shall be\n",
      "levied on all taxable intra-State supplies.\n",
      "10.2 The IGST Model: Inter-State supply of goods or services shall be subjected\n",
      "to integrated GST (Integrated tax / IGST). The IGST model is a unique\n",
      "contribution of India in the field of VAT. The IGST Model envisages that Centre\n",

      "CGST, and SGST on his purchases. The Exporting State will transfer to the\n",

      "['GOODS AND SERVICE TAX (GST)\\nCONCEPT & STATUS\\nCENTRAL BOARD OF INDIRECT TAXES AND CUSTOMS (CBIC)\\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE\\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE\\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA\\nAS ON 01st June, ', '\\nThe uniform system of taxation, which, with a few exceptions of no\\ngreat consequence, takes place in all the different parts of the United\\nKingdom of Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the\\ncountry, the inland and coasting trade, almost entirely free. The\\ninland trade is almost perfectly free, and the greater part of goods\\nmay be carried from one end of the kingdom to the other, without\\nrequiring any permit or let-pass, without being subject to question,\\nvisit, or examination from the revenue officers. ……This freedom of\\ninterior commerce, the effect of uniformity of the system of taxation, is\\nperhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of Great Britain;\\nevery great country being necessarily the best and most extensive\\nmarket for the greater part of the productions of its own industry. If\\nthe same freedom, in consequence of the same uniformity, could be\\nextended to Ireland and the plantations, both the grandeur of the state\\nand the prosperity of every part of the empire, would probably be still\\ngreater than at present”\\n– Adam Smith in ‘Wealth of Nations’\\n1. INTRODUCTION:\\nWhether it was uniformity of taxation and consequent free interior trade or\\npossession of ‘the jewel in the crown’ at the root of prosperity of Britain is\\ndebatable, nonetheless the words of father of modern economics on the benefits\\nof uniformity of system of taxation cannot be taken too lightly. Before\\nimplementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST), Indian taxation system was a\\nfarrago of central, state and local area levies. By subsuming more than a score of\\ntaxes under GST, road to a harmonized system of indirect tax has been paved\\nmaking India an economic union.\\n2. CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN INDIA\\nBEFORE GST :\\n2.1 Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be levied\\nor collected except by authority of law. As per Article 246 of the Constitution,\\nParliament has exclusive powers to make laws in respect of matters given in\\nUnion List (List I of the Seventh Schedule) and State Government has the\\nexclusive jurisdiction to legislate on the matters containing in State List (List II of\\nthe Seventh Schedule). In respect of the matters contained in Concurrent List (List\\nIII of the Seventh Schedule), both the Central Government and State\\nGovernments have concurrent powers to legislate.\\n2.2 Before advent of GST, the most important sources of indirect tax revenue\\nfor the Union were customs duty (entry 83 of Union List), central excise duty\\n(entry 84 of Union List), and service tax (entry 97 of Union List). Although entry\\n92C was inserted in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution by\\nthe Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, ', 'for levy of taxes on\\nservices, it was not notified. So tax on services were continued to be levied under\\nthe residual entry, i.e. entry 97, of the Union List till GST came into force. The\\nUnion also levied tax called Central Sales Tax (CST) on inter-State sale and\\npurchase of goods and on inter-State consignments of goods by virtue of entry\\n92A and 92B respectively. CST however is assigned to the State of origin, as per\\nCentral Sales Tax Act, ', 'made under Article 269 of the Constitution.\\n2.3 On the State side, the most important sources of tax revenue were tax on\\nsale and purchase (entry 54 of the State List), excise duty on alcoholic liquors,\\nopium and narcotics (entry 51 of the State List), Taxes on luxuries,\\nentertainments, amusements, betting and gambling (entry 62 of the State List),\\noctroi or entry tax (entry 52 of the State List) and electricity tax ((entry 53 of the\\nState List). CST was also an important source of revenue though the same was\\nlevied by the Union.\\n3. HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF INDIRECT TAXATION IN POST-\\nINDEPENDENCE INDIA TILL GST:\\n3.1 In post-Independence period, central excise duty was levied on a few\\ncommodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs,\\nand consumer goods were outside the net by and large. The first set of reform was\\nsuggested by the Taxation Enquiry Commission (', \"-54) under the\\nchairmanship of Dr. John Matthai. The Commission recommended that sales tax\\nshould be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue with Union\\ngovernments' intervention allowed generally only in case of inter-State sales. It\\nalso recommended levy of a tax on inter-State sales subject to a ceiling of 1%,\\nwhich the States would administer and also retain the revenue.\\n3.2 The power to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the course of inter-\\nState trade and commerce was assigned to the Union by the Constitution (Sixth\\nAmendment) Act, \", 'By mid-', 's, central excise duty was extended to most\\nmanufactured goods. Central excise duty was levied on unit, called specific duty,\\nand on value, called ad valorem duty. The number of rates was too many with no\\noffsetting of taxes paid on inputs leading to significant cascading and\\nclassification disputes.\\n3.3 The Indirect Taxation Enquiry Committee constituted in ', 'under Shri L\\nK Jha recommended, inter alia, converting specific rates into ad valorem rates,\\nrate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of value added tax at\\nmanufacturing level (MANVAT). In ', ', the recommendation of the Jha\\nCommittee on moving on to value added tax in manufacturing was partially\\nimplemented. This was called modified value added tax (MODVAT). In principle,\\nduty was payable on value addition but in the beginning it was limited to select\\ninputs and manufactured goods only with one-to-one correlation between input\\nand manufactured goods for eligibility to take input tax credit. The comprehensive\\ncoverage of MODVAT was achieved by ', '-97.\\n3.4 The next wave of reform in indirect tax sphere came with the New\\nEconomic Policy of ', 'The Tax Reforms Committee under the chairmanship\\nof Prof. Raja J Chelliah was appointed in ', 'This Committee recommended\\nbroadening of the tax base by taxing services and pruning exemptions,\\nconsolidation and lowering of rates, extension of MODVAT on all inputs\\nincluding capital goods. It suggested that reform of tax structure must have to be\\naccompanied by a reform of tax administration, if complete benefits were to be\\nderived from the tax reforms. Many of the recommendations of the Chelliah\\nCommittee were implemented. In ', '-', ', tax rates were merged in three rates,\\nwith additional rates on a few luxury goods. In ', '-01, three rates were merged\\ninto one rate called Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). A few commodities\\nwere subjected to special excise duty.\\n3.5 Taxation of services by the Union was introduced in ', 'bringing in its\\nambit only three services, namely general insurance, telecommunication and stock\\nbroking. Gradually, more and more services were brought into the fold. Over the\\nnext decade, more and more services were brought under the tax net. In ', ', tax\\nrate on three services was 5% which gradually increased and in ', 'it was 15%\\n(including cess). Before ', ', services were taxed under a ‘positive list’\\napproach. This approach was prone to ‘tax avoidance’. In ', 'budget, negative\\nlist approach was adopted where 17 services were out of taxation net and all other\\nservices were subject to tax. In ', ', the input tax credit scheme for CENVAT\\nand Service Tax was merged to permit cross utilization of credits across these\\ntaxes.\\n3.6 Before state level VAT was introduced by States in the first half of the first\\ndecade of this century, sales tax was levied in States since independence. Sales tax\\nwas plagued by some serious flaws. It was levied by States in an uncoordinated\\nmanner the consequences of which were different rates of sales tax on different\\ncommodities in different States. Rates of sales tax were more than ten in some\\nStates and these varied for the same commodity in different States. Inter-state\\nsales were subjected to levy of Central Sales Tax. As this tax was appropriated by\\nthe exporting State credit was not allowed by the dealer in the importing State.\\nThis resulted into exportation of tax from richer to poorer states and also\\ncascading of taxes. Interestingly, States had power of taxation over services from\\nthe very beginning. States levied tax on advertisements, luxuries, entertainments,\\namusements, betting and gambling.\\n3.7 A report, titled \"Reform of Domestic Trade Taxes in India\", on reforming\\nindirect taxes, especially State sales tax, by National Institute of Public Finance\\nand Policy under the leadership of Dr. Amaresh Bagchi, was prepared in ', '\\nThis Report prepared the ground for implementation of VAT in States. Some of\\nthe key recommendations were; replacing sales tax by VAT by moving over to a\\nmultistage system of taxation; allowing input tax credits for all inputs, including\\non machinery and equipment; harmonization and rationalization of tax rates\\nacross States with two or three rates within specified bands; pruning of\\nexemptions and concessions except for a basic threshold limit and items like\\nunprocessed food; zero rating of exports, inter-State sales and consignment\\ntransfers to registered dealers; taxing inter-State sales to non-registered persons as\\nlocal sales; modernization of tax administration, computerization of operations\\nand simplification of forms and procedures.\\n3.8 The first preliminary discussion on transition from sales tax regime to VAT\\nregime took place in a meeting of Chief Ministers convened by the Union Finance\\nMinister in ', 'A standing Committee of State Finance Ministers was\\nconstituted, as a result of meeting of the Union Finance Ministers and Chief\\nMinisters in November, ', ', to deliberate on the design of VAT which was later\\nmade the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). Haryana was\\nthe first State to implement VAT, in ', 'In ', ', VAT was implemented in\\nmost of the states. Uttar Pradesh was the last State to implement VAT, from 1st\\nJanuary, ', '\\n4. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON GST / VAT:\\n4.1 VAT and GST are used inter-changeably as the latter denotes\\ncomprehensiveness of VAT by coverage of goods and services. France was the\\nfirst country to implement VAT, in ', 'Presently, more than 160 countries have\\nimplemented GST / VAT in some form or the other. The most popular form of\\nVAT is where taxes paid on inputs are allowed to be adjusted in the liability at the\\noutput. The VAT or GST regime in practice varies from one country to another in\\nterms of its technical aspects like ‘definition of supply’, ‘extent of coverage of\\ngoods and services’, ‘treatment of exemptions and zero rating’ etc. However, at a\\nbroader level, it has one common principle, it is a destination based consumption\\ntax. From economic point of view, VAT is considered to be a superior system over\\nsales tax of taxing consumption because the former is neutral in allocation of\\nresources as it taxes value addition. Besides, there are certain distinct advantages\\nof VAT. It is less cascading making the taxation system transparent and anti-\\ninflationary. From revenue point of view, VAT leads to greater compliance\\nbecause of creation of transaction trails.\\n4.2 When compared globally, VAT structures are either overly centralized\\nwhere tax is levied and administered by the Central government (Germany,\\nSwitzerland, Austria), or dual GST structure wherein both Centre and States\\nadminister tax independently (Canada) or with some co-ordination between the\\nnational and sub-national entities (Brazil, Russia). While a centralized structure\\nreduces fiscal autonomy for the States, a decentralized structure enhances\\ncompliance burden for the taxpayers. Canada is a federal country with unique\\nmodel of taxation in which certain provinces have joined federal GST and others\\nhave not. Provinces which administer their taxes separately are called ‘non-\\nparticipating provinces’, whereas provinces which have teamed up with the Federal\\nGovernment for tax administration are called ‘participating provinces’.\\n4.3 The rate of GST varies across countries. While Malaysia has a lower rate of\\n6% (Malaysia though scrapped GST in ', 'due to popular uproar against it),\\nHungary has one of the highest rate of 27%. Australia levies GST at the rate of\\n10% whereas Canada has multiple rate slabs. The average rate of VAT across the\\nEU is around 19.5%.\\n5. NEED FOR GST IN INDIA:\\n5.1 The introduction of CENVAT removed to a great extent cascading burden\\nby expanding the coverage of credit for all inputs, including capital goods.\\nCENVAT scheme later also allowed credit of services and the basket of inputs,\\ncapital goods and input services could be used for payment of both central excise\\nduty and service tax. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the States has removed\\nthe cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as well as tax paid on\\nprevious purchases and has again been an improvement over the previous sales tax\\nregime.\\n5.2 But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. The\\nincompleteness in CENVAT is that it has yet not been extended to include chain of\\nvalue addition in the distributive trade below the stage of production. Similarly, in\\nthe State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been removed and\\nthe cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained unrelieved. Moreover,\\nthere are several taxes in the States, such as, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc.\\nwhich have still not been subsumed in the VAT. Further, there has also not been\\nany integration of VAT on goods with tax on services at the State level with\\nremoval of cascading effect of service tax.\\n5.3 CST was another source of distortion in terms of its cascading nature. It was\\nalso against one of the basic principles of consumption taxes that tax should accrue\\nto the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. Despite remarkable\\nharmonization in VAT regimes under the auspices of the EC, the national market\\nwas fragmented with too many obstacles in free movement of goods necessitated\\nby procedural requirement under VAT and CST.\\n5.4 In the constitutional scheme, taxation powers on goods was with Central\\nGovernment but it was limited up to the stage of manufacture and production while\\nStates have powers to tax sale and purchase of goods. Centre had powers to tax\\nservices and States also had powers to tax certain services specified in clause\\n(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution. This sort of division of taxing powers\\ncreated a grey zone which led to legal disputes. Determination of what constitutes\\na goods or service is difficult because in modern complex system of production, a\\nproduct is normally a mixture of goods and services.\\n5.5 As can be seen from the previous paragraphs, India moved towards value\\nadded taxation both at Central and State level, and this process was complete by\\n', 'Integration of Central VAT and State VAT therefore is nothing but an\\ninevitable consequence of the reform process. The Constitution of India envisages\\na federal nature of power bestowed upon both Union and States in the Constitution\\nitself. As a natural corollary of this, any unification of the taxation system required\\na dual GST, levied and collected both by the Union and the States.\\n6. GST : A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:\\n6.1 The Kelkar Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management\\n(FRBM) recommended in ', 'introduction of a comprehensive tax on all goods\\nand service replacing Central level VAT and State level VATs. It recommended\\nreplacing all indirect taxes except the customs duty with value added tax on all\\ngoods and services with complete set off in all stages of making of a product.\\n6.2 In the year ', ', the then Prime Minister introduced the concept of GST and\\nset up a committee to design a GST model for the country. In ', ', the Central\\nGovernment formed a taskforce on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management,\\nwhich in ', 'recommended GST to replace the existing tax regime by\\nintroducing a comprehensive tax on all goods and services replacing Central level\\nVAT and State level VATs. It recommended replacing all indirect taxes except the\\ncustoms duty with value added tax on all goods and services with complete set off\\nin all stages of the value chain. An announcement was made by the then Union\\nFinance Minister in Budget (', '-07) to the effect that GST would be introduced\\nwith effect from April 1, ', 'and that the EC, on his request, would work with the\\nCentral Government to prepare a road map for introduction of GST in India. After\\nthis announcement, the EC decided to set up a Joint Working Group in May 10,\\n', ', with the then Adviser to the Union Finance Minister and Member-Secretary\\nof the Empowered Committee as its Co-conveners and four Joint Secretaries of the\\nDepartment of Revenue of Union Finance Ministry and all Finance Secretaries of\\nthe States as its members. This Joint Working Group got itself divided into three\\nSub-Groups and had several rounds of internal discussions as well as interaction\\nwith experts and representatives of Chambers of Commerce & Industry. On the\\nbasis of these discussions and interaction, the Sub-Groups submitted their reports\\nwhich were then integrated and consolidated into the report of Joint Working\\nGroup (November 19, ', ').\\n6.3 This report was discussed in detail in the meeting of the EC on November\\n28, ', ', and the States were also requested to communicate their observations on\\nthe report in writing. On the basis of these discussions in the EC and the written\\nobservations, certain modifications were considered necessary and were discussed\\nwith the Co-conveners and the representatives of the Department of Revenue of\\nUnion Finance Ministry. With the modifications duly made, a final version of the\\nviews of EC on the model and road map for the GST was prepared (April 30,\\n', '). These views of EC were then sent to the Government of India, and the\\ncomments of Government of India were received on December 12, ', 'These\\ncomments were duly considered by the EC (December 16, ', '), and it was\\ndecided that a Committee of Principal Secretaries/Secretaries of Finance/Taxation\\nand Commissioners of Trade Taxes of the States would be set up to consider these\\ncomments, and submit their views. These views were submitted and were accepted\\nin principle by the EC (January 21, ', '). Based on discussions within the EC and\\nbetween the EC and the Central Government, the EC released its First Discussion\\nPaper (FDP) on GST in November, ', 'This spelled out the features of the\\nproposed GST and has formed the basis for discussion between the Centre and the\\nStates.\\n7. CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING GST:\\n7.1 In the discussion that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST,\\nthere were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement\\nbetween Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform\\nas vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of\\ninterests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of the challenging issues,\\naddressed in the run up to GST, were the following:\\n7.2 Origin-based versus Destination-based taxation: GST is a destination based\\nconsumption tax. Under destination based taxation, tax accrues to the destination\\nplace where consumption of the goods or services takes place. The existing VAT\\nregime was based on origin principle where Central Sales Tax was assigned to the\\nState of origin where production or sale happened and not to the State where\\nconsumption happened. Many manufacturing States expressed concerns over the\\nloss of revenue on account of shift from origin based taxation to destination based\\ntaxation.\\n7.2.1 An argument put forward on behalf of producing states in support of origin\\nbased taxation is that they need to collect at least some tax from inter-State sales in\\norder to recover the cost of infrastructure and public services provided by the State\\nGovernments to the industries producing the goods which are consumed in other\\nstates. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that in the absence of a tax\\non inter-State sales, the location of export industries within their jurisdiction would\\nnot contribute to the tax revenues of the exporting state. This view was missing the\\nfact that any value addition in a jurisdiction necessarily means extra income in the\\nhands of the residents of that jurisdiction. Spending of this income on consumer\\ngoods expands the sales tax base of the producing states and thereby contributes to\\ntheir revenues. In fact, to the extent that consumer expenditures are dependent on\\nthe level of income of the residents of a State, it is the producing States that stand\\nto gain the most in additional sales tax revenues (even under the destination basis\\nof consumption taxes) from increased export output.\\n7.3 Rate Structure and Compensation: There was uncertainty about gains in\\nrevenue after implementation of GST. Though attempts were made to estimate a\\nrevenue neutral rate, nonetheless it remains an estimate only. It was difficult to\\nestimate accurately as to how much the States will gain from tax on services and\\nhow much they will lose on account of removal of cascading effect and phasing\\nout of CST. In view of this, States asked for compensation during the first five\\nyears of implementation of GST.\\n7.3.1 A Committee headed by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind\\nSubramanian on possible tax rates under GST suggested RNR (Revenue Neutral\\nRate). The term RNR refers to that single rate, which preserves revenue at desired\\n(current) levels. This would differ from the standard rate, which is the rate that\\nwould apply to a majority of goods and services. In practice, there will be a\\nstructure of rates, but for the sake of analytical clarity and precision it is\\nappropriate to think of the RNR as a single rate. It is a given single rate that gets\\nconverted into a whole rate structure, depending on policy choices about\\nexemptions, what commodities to charge at a lower rate and what to charge at a\\nvery high rate.\\n7.3.2 The Committee recommended RNR of 15-15.5% (to be levied by the Centre\\nand States combined). The lower rates (to be applied to certain goods consumed by\\nthe poor) should be 12%. Further, the sin or demerit rates (to be applied on luxury\\ncars, aerated beverages, pan masala, and tobacco) should be 40%.\\n7.4 Dispute Settlement: A harmonized system of taxation necessarily required\\nthat all stakeholders stick to the decisions taken by the supreme body, which was\\nlater constituted as the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council). However,\\nthe possibility of departure from the recommendations of such body cannot be\\ncompletely ruled out. Any departure would definitely affect other stakeholders and\\nin such circumstances there must be a statutory body to which affected parties may\\napproach for dispute resolution. The nature of such dispute resolution body was a\\nbone of contention. Under the Constitution (One Hundred Fifteenth Amendment)\\nBill, ', ', a Goods and Services Tax Dispute Settlement Authority was to be\\nconstituted for this purpose. This body was judicial in nature. The proposed\\nconstitution of this Authority was challenged because its powers would override\\nthe supremacy of the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Constitution (One\\nHundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, ', 'departed from the previous GST\\namendment bill and proposed that the Goods and Services Tax Council may decide\\nabout the modalities to resolve disputes arising out of its recommendations.\\n7.5 Alcohol and Petroleum products: Alcoholic liquor for human consumption\\nand petroleum products are major contributor to revenue of States. As States were\\nuncertain about impact of GST on their finances and moreover loss of autonomy in\\ncollection of tax revenue, States unanimously argued for exclusion of these\\nproducts from the ambit of GST. In the 115th Amendment Bill alcoholic liquor for\\nhuman consumption and five petroleum products namely crude petroleum, high\\nspeed diesel, motor spirit or petrol, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas were kept\\nout of GST. But in the 122nd Amendment Bill, only alcoholic liquor for human\\nconsumption was kept outside GST and above mentioned five petroleum products\\nwere proposed to be brought under GST from a date to be recommended by the\\nCouncil. The Central Government has also retained its power to tax tobacco and\\ntobacco products, though these are also under GST. Thus, to ensure smooth\\ntransition and provide fiscal buffer to States, it was agreed to keep alcohol\\ncompletely out of the ambit of GST.\\n8. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:\\n8.1 As explained above, unification of Central VAT and State VAT was\\npossible in form of a dual levy under the constitutional scheme. Power of taxation\\nis assigned to either Union or States subject-wise under Schedule VII of the\\nConstitution. While the Centre is empowered to tax goods up to the production or\\nmanufacturing stage, the States have the power to tax goods at distribution stage.\\nThe Union can tax services using residuary powers but States could not. Under a\\nunified Goods and Services Tax scheme, both should have power to tax the\\ncomplete supply chain from production to distribution, and both goods and\\nservices. The scheme of the Constitution did not provide for any concurrent taxing\\npowers to the Union as well as the States and for the purpose of introducing goods\\nand services tax amendment of the Constitution conferring simultaneous power on\\nParliament as well as the State Legislatures to make laws for levying goods and\\nservices tax on every transaction of supply of goods or services was necessary.\\n8.2 The Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill, ', ', in relation to the\\nintroduction of GST, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 11-03-', 'The Bill was\\nreferred to the Standing Committee on Finance on 29-03-', 'The Standing\\nCommittee submitted its report on the Bill in August, ', 'However, the Bill,\\nwhich was pending in the Lok Sabha, lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok\\nSabha.\\n8.3 The Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, ', 'was introduced in the 16th\\nLok Sabha on 19-12-', 'The Constitution Amendment Bill was passed by the\\nLok Sabha in May, ', 'The Bill was referred to the Select Committee of Rajya\\nSabha on 12-05-', 'The Select Committee submitted its Report on the Bill on\\n22-07-', 'The Bill with certain amendments was finally passed in the Rajya\\nSabha and thereafter by Lok Sabha in August, ', 'Further the bill was ratified by\\nrequired number of States and received assent of the President on 8th September,\\n', 'and has since been enacted as Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, ', '\\nw.e.f. 16-09-', '\\n8.4 The important changes introduced in the Constitution by the 101st\\nAmendment Act are the following:\\na) Insertion of new article 246A which makes enabling provisions for the\\nUnion and States with respect to the GST legislation. It further specifies that\\nParliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to GST on inter-\\nState supplies.\\nb) Article 268A of the Constitution has been omitted. The said article\\nempowered the Government of India to levy taxes on services. As tax on\\nservices has been brought under GST, such a provision was no longer\\nrequired.\\nc) Article 269A has been inserted which provides for goods and services tax on\\nsupplies in the course of inter-State trade or commerce which shall be levied\\nand collected by the Government of India and such tax shall be apportioned\\nbetween the Union and the States in the manner as may be provided by\\nParliament by law on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax\\nCouncil.

THE DESIGN OF INDIAN GST:\\n10.1 Concurrent dual model of GST: India has adopted dual GST model because\\nof its unique federal nature. Under this model, tax is levied concurrently by the\\nCentre as well as the States on a common base, i.e. supply of goods or services or\\nboth. GST to be levied by the Centre would be called Central GST (Central tax /\\nCGST) and that to be levied by the States would be called State GST (State Tax /\\nSGST). State GST (State Tax / SGST) would be called UTGST (Union territory\\ntax) in Union Territories without legislature. CGST & SGST / UTGST shall be\\nlevied on all taxable intra-State supplies.\\n10.2 The IGST Model: Inter-State supply of goods or services shall be subjected\\nto integrated GST (Integrated tax / IGST). The IGST model is a unique\\ncontribution of India in the field of VAT. The IGST Model envisages that Centre\\nwould levy IGST (Integrated Goods and Service Tax) which would be CGST plus\\nSGST on all inter-State supply of goods or services or both. The inter-State\\nsupplier will pay IGST on value addition after adjusting available credit of IGST,\\nCGST, and SGST on his purchases. The Exporting State will transfer to the\\nCentre the credit of SGST used in payment of IGST. The person based in the\\ndestination State will claim credit of IGST while discharging his output tax\\nliability in his own State. The Centre will transfer to the importing State the\\ncredit of IGST used in payment of SGST. The relevant information will also be\\nsubmitted to the Central Agency which will act as a clearing house mechanism,\\nverify the claims and inform the respective governments to transfer the funds. The\\nmajor advantages of IGST Model are:\\na) Maintenance of uninterrupted ITC chain on inter-State transactions.\\nb) No upfront payment of tax or substantial blockage of funds for the inter-\\nState supplier or recipient.\\nc) No refund claim in exporting State, as ITC is used up while paying the\\ntax.\\nd) Self-monitoring model.\\ne) Model takes ‘Business to Business’ as well as ‘Business to Consumer’\\ntransactions into account.\\n10.3 Tax Rates: Owing to unique Indian socio-economic milieu, four rates\\nnamely 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% have been adopted. Besides, some goods and\\nservices are exempt also. Rate for precious metals and affordable housing are an\\nexception to ‘four-tax slab-rule’ and the same has been fixed at 3% and 1%\\nrespectively. In addition, unworked diamonds, precious stones, etc. attracts a rate\\nof 0.25%. A cess over the peak rate of 28% on certain specified luxury and demerit\\ngoods, like tobacco and tobacco products, pan masala, aerated water, motor\\nvehicles is imposed to compensate States for any revenue loss on account of\\nimplementation of GST. The list of goods and services in case of which reverse\\ncharge would be applicable has also been notified.\\n10.4 Compensation to States: The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to\\nStates) Act, ', 'provides for compensation to the States for the loss of revenue\\narising on account of implementation of the goods and services tax.\\nCompensation will be provided to a State for a period of five years from the date\\non which the State brings its SGST Act into force. For the purpose of calculating\\nthe compensation amount in any financial year, year ', '-16 will be assumed to\\nbe the base year, for calculating the revenue to be protected. The growth rate of\\nrevenue for a State during the five-year period is assumed be 14% per annum. The\\nbase year tax revenue consists of the states’ tax revenues from: (i) State Value\\nAdded Tax (VAT), (ii) central sales tax, (iii) entry tax, octroi, local body tax, (iv)\\ntaxes on luxuries, (v) taxes on advertisements, etc. However, any revenue among\\nthese taxes arising related to supply of alcohol for human consumption, and five\\nspecified petroleum products, will not be accounted as part of the base year\\nrevenue. A GST Compensation Cess is levied on the supply of certain goods and\\nservices, as recommended by the GST Council to finance the compensation cess.\\n10.5 E-Way Bill System: The introduction of e-way (electronic way) bill is a\\nmonumental shift from the earlier “Departmental Policing Model” to a “Self-\\nDeclaration Model”. It envisages one e-way bill for movement of the goods\\nthroughout the country, thereby ensuring a hassle free movement for transporters\\nthroughout the country. The e-way bill system has been introduced nation-wide for\\nall inter-State movement of goods with effect from 01-04-', 'As regards intra-\\nState supplies, option was given to States to choose any date on or before\\n03-06-', 'All States have notified e-way bill rules for intra-State supplies last\\nbeing NCT of Delhi where it was introduced w.e.f. 16-06-', 'New features in the\\ne-way bill system have been introduced such as the auto calculation of distance\\nbased on PIN codes for the generation of e-way bill and blocking the generation of\\nmultiple e-way bills against one invoice.\\n10.6 Anti-Profiteering Mechanism: Implementation of GST in many countries\\nwas coupled with increase in inflation and the prices of the commodities. This\\nhappened in spite of the availability of the tax credit. This was happening because\\nthe supplier was not passing on the benefit to the consumer and thereby indulging\\nin illegal profiteering. Any reduction in rate of tax or the benefit of increased input\\ntax credit should have been passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate\\nreduction in prices.\\n', 'National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAPA) has been constituted under\\nGST by the Central Government to examine the complaints of non-passing the\\nbenefit of reduced tax incidence. The Authority shall cease to exist after the expiry\\nof two years from the date on which the Chairman enters upon his office unless the\\nCouncil recommends otherwise.\\n', 'The Authority may determine whether any reduction in the rate of tax or\\nthe benefit of input tax credit has been passed on to the recipient by way of\\ncommensurate reduction in prices. It can order reduction in prices, imposition of\\npenalty, cancellation of registration and any other decision as may deem fit, after\\ninquiry into the case.\\n10.7 Concept of Supply: GST would be applicable on supply of goods or services\\nas against the present concept of tax on manufacture of goods or on sale of goods\\nor on provision of services. It includes all sorts of activities like manufacture, sale,\\nbarter, exchange, transfer etc. It also includes supplies made without consideration\\nwhen such supplies are made in certain specified situations.\\n10.8 Threshold Exemption: Threshold limits of aggregate turnover for\\nexemption from registration and payment of GST for the suppliers of goods\\nwould be Rs. 40 lakhs and Rs. 20 lakhs (in case of States of Arunachal Pradesh,\\nManipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim, Telangana,\\nTripura and Uttarakhand) with effect from 01-04-', '\\nThreshold limit of aggregate turnover for exemption from registration and\\npayment of GST for suppliers of services would be Rs. 20 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs\\n(in case of States of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura).\\nA common threshold exemption applies to both CGST and SGST. The benefit of\\nthreshold exemption, however, is not available in inter-State supplies of goods.\\n10.9 Composition Scheme: Composition scheme has been formulated for small\\nbusinessmen being supplier of goods and supplier of restaurant services. Under\\nthe scheme, person with turnover up to Rs. 1.5 crore (Rs. 75 lakhs in States of\\nArunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura\\nand Uttarakhand) needs to pay tax equal to 1% to 5% on his turnover and needs to\\nfile his returns annually with quarterly payment from FY ', '-20.\\nComposition scheme has also been formulated for supplier of services (to those\\nwho are not eligible for the presently available composition scheme).

The economic\\nintegration of India was completed on 08-07-', 'when the State of J&K also\\npassed the SGST Act and the Central Government also subsequently extended the\\nCGST Act to J&K.\\n11.2. In its 28th meeting held in New Delhi on 21-07-', ', the GST Council\\nrecommended certain amendments in the CGST Act, IGST Act, UTGST Act and\\nthe GST (Compensation to States) Act. These amendments have been passed by\\nParliament and have been enacted w.e.f. 01-02-', ', as the Central Goods and\\nServices Tax (Amendment) Act, ', ', the Integrated Goods and Services Tax\\n(Amendment) Act, ', ', the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax\\n(Amendment) Act, ', 'and the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to\\nStates) Amendment Act, ', ', respectively.\\n11.3. On 22-06-', ', the first notification was issued for GST and notified\\ncertain sections under CGST. Since then, 178 notifications under CGST Act have\\nbeen issued notifying sections, notifying rules, amendment to rules and for waiver\\nof penalty, etc. 19, 34 and 2 notifications have also been issued under IGST Act,\\nUTGST Act and GST (Compensation to States) Act respectively. Further, 87, 90,\\n87 and 9 rate related notifications each have been issued under the CGST Act,\\nIGST Act, UTGST Act and GST (Compensation to States) Act respectively.\\nSimilar notifications have been issued by all the States under the respective SGST\\nAct. Apart from the notifications, 106 circulars, 18 orders and 13 Removal of\\nDifficulty Orders have also been issued by CBIC on various subjects like proper\\nofficers, ease of exports, and extension of last dates for filling up various forms,\\netc.\\n12. ROLE OF CBIC:\\n12.1 CBIC is playing an active role in the drafting of GST law and procedures,\\nparticularly the CGST and IGST law, which will be exclusive domain of the\\nCentre. This apart, the CBIC has prepared itself for meeting the implementation\\nchallenges, which are quite formidable. The number of taxpayers has gone up\\nsignificantly. The existing IT infrastructure of CBIC has been suitably scaled up\\nto handle such large volumes of data. Based on the legal provisions and procedure\\nfor GST, the content of work-flow software such as ACES (Automated Central\\nExcise & Service Tax) would require re-engineering. The name of IT project of\\nCBIC under GST is ‘SAKSHAM’ involving a total project value of Rs. 2,256 Cr.\\n12.2 Augmentation of human resources would be necessary to handle large\\ntaxpayers’ base in GST scattered across the length and breadth of the country.\\nCapacity building, particularly in the field of Accountancy and Information\\nTechnology for the departmental officers has to be taken up in a big way. A\\nmassive four-tier training programme has been conducted under the leadership of\\nNACIN. This training project is aimed at imparting training on GST law and\\nprocedures to more than 60,000 officers of CBIC and Commercial Tax officers of\\nState Governments.\\n12.3 CBIC would be responsible for administration of the CGST and IGST law.\\nIn addition, excise duty regime would continue to be administered by the CBIC for\\nlevy and collection of central excise duty on five specified petroleum products as\\nwell as on tobacco products. CBIC would also continue to handle the work\\nrelating to levy and collection of customs duties.\\n12.4 Director General of Anti-profiteering, CBIC has been mandated to conduct\\ndetailed enquiry on anti-profiteering cases and should give his recommendation\\nfor consideration of the National Anti-profiteering Authority.\\n12.5 CBIC has been instrumental in handholding the implementation of GST. It\\nhad set up the Feedback and Action Room which monitored the GST\\nimplementation challenges faced by the taxpayer and act as an active interface\\nbetween the taxpayer and the Government.\\n13. GOODS & SERVICES TAX NETWORK:\\n13.1 Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has been set up by the\\nGovernment as a private company under erstwhile Section 25 of the Companies\\nAct, ', 'GSTN would provide three front end services to the taxpayers namely\\nregistration, payment and return. Besides providing these services to the taxpayers,\\nGSTN would be developing back-end IT modules for 27 States who have opted for\\nthe same. Infosys has been appointed as Managed Service Provider (MSP). GSTN\\nhas selected 73 IT, ITeS and financial technology companies and 1 Commissioner\\nof Commercial Taxes (CCT, Karnataka), to be called GST Suvidha Providers\\n(GSPs). GSPs would develop applications to be used by taxpayers for interacting\\nwith the GSTN. The diagram below shows the work distribution under GST.\\n13.2 Central Government holds 24.5 percent stake in GSTN while the state\\ngovernment holds 24.5 percent. The remaining 51 per cent are held by non-\\nGovernment financial institutions, HDFC and HDFC Bank hold 20%, ICICI Bank\\nholds 10%, NSE Strategic Investment holds 10% and LIC Housing Finance holds\\n10%. The GST Council in its 27th meeting held on 04-05-', 'has approved the\\nchange in shareholding pattern of GSTN. Considering the nature of ‘state’\\nfunction’ performed by GSTN, the GST Council felt that GSTN be converted into\\na fully owned Government company. Accordingly, the Council approved\\nacquisition of entire 51 per cent of equity held by non-Governmental institutions in\\nGSTN amounting to Rs. 5.1 crore, equally by the Centre and the State\\nGovernments.\\n13.3 The design of GST systems is based on role based access. The taxpayer can\\naccess his own data through identified applications like registration, return, view\\nledger etc. The tax official having jurisdiction, as per GST law, can access the data.\\nData can be accessed by audit authorities as per law. No other entity can have any\\naccess to data available with GSTN.\\n14. GST: A GAME CHANGER FOR INDIAN ECONOMY:\\n14.1 GST will have a multiplier effect on the economy with benefits accruing to\\nvarious sectors as discussed below.\\n14.2 Benefits to the exporters: The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in\\nGST, complete and comprehensive setoff of input goods and services and phasing\\nout of Central Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured\\ngoods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and\\nservices in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The\\nuniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in\\nreducing the compliance cost.\\n14.3 Benefits to small traders and entrepreneurs: GST has increased the threshold\\nfor GST registration for small businesses. Those units having aggregate annual\\nturnover more than Rs 20 lakhs (Rs. 10 lakhs in certain cases) in case of supplier of\\nservices and Rs. 40 lakhs (Rs. 20 lakhs in certain cases) in case of supplier of\\ngoods have be registered under GST. Unlike multiple registrations under different\\ntax regimes earlier, a single registration is needed under GST in one State. An\\nadditional benefit under Composition scheme has also been provided for\\nbusinesses with aggregate annual turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore (Rs. 75 lakhs in\\ncertain cases) in case of supplier of goods and restaurant services and Rs. 50 lakhs\\nin case of supplier of services. With the creation of a seamless national market\\nacross the country, small enterprises will have an opportunity to expand their\\nnational footprint with minimal investment.\\n14.4 Benefits to agriculture and Industry: GST will give more relief to industry,\\ntrade and agriculture through a more comprehensive and wider coverage of input\\ntax set-off and service tax set-off, subsuming of several Central and State taxes in\\nthe GST and phasing out of CST. The transparent and complete chain of set-offs\\nwhich will result in widening of tax base and better tax compliance may also lead\\nto lowering of tax burden on an average dealer in industry, trade and agriculture.\\n14.5 Benefits for common consumers: With the introduction of GST, the\\ncascading effects of CENVAT, State VAT and service tax will be more\\ncomprehensively removed with a continuous chain of set-off from the producer’s\\npoint to the retailer’s point than what was possible under the prevailing CENVAT\\nand VAT regime. Certain major Central and State taxes will also be subsumed in\\nGST and CST will be phased out. Other things remaining the same, the burden of\\ntax on goods would, in general, fall under GST and that would benefit the\\nconsumers.\\n14.6 Promote “Make in India”: GST will help to create a unified common\\nnational market for India, giving a boost to foreign investment and “Make in India”\\ncampaign. It will prevent cascading of taxes and make products cheaper, thus\\nboosting aggregate demand. It will result in harmonization of laws, procedures and\\nrates of tax. It will boost export and manufacturing activity, generate more\\nemployment and thus increase GDP with gainful employment leading to\\nsubstantive economic growth. Ultimately it will help in poverty eradication by\\ngenerating more employment and more financial resources. More efficient\\nneutralization of taxes especially for exports thereby making our products more\\ncompetitive in the international market and give boost to Indian Exports. It will\\nalso improve the overall investment climate in the country which will naturally\\nbenefit the development in the states. Uniform CGST & SGST and IGST rates will\\nreduce the incentive for evasion by eliminating rate arbitrage between neighboring\\nStates and that between intra and inter-State supplies. Average tax burden on\\ncompanies is likely to come down which is expected to reduce prices and lower\\nprices mean more consumption, which in turn means more production thereby\\nhelping in the growth of the industries. This will create India as a “Manufacturing\\nhub”.\\n14.7 Ease of Doing Business: Simpler tax regime with fewer exemptions along\\nwith reduction in multiplicity of taxes that are at present governing our indirect tax\\nsystem will lead to simplification and uniformity. Reduction in compliance costs as\\nmultiple record-keeping for a variety of taxes will not be needed, therefore, lesser\\ninvestment of resources and manpower in maintaining records. It will result in\\nsimplified and automated procedures for various processes such as registration,\\nreturns, refunds, tax payments. All interaction shall be through the common GSTN\\nportal, therefore, less public interface between the taxpayer and the tax\\nadministration. It will improve environment of compliance as all returns to be filed\\nonline, input credits to be verified online, encouraging more paper trail of\\ntransactions. Common procedures for registration of taxpayers, refund of taxes,\\nuniform formats of tax return, common tax base, common system of classification\\nof goods and services will lend greater certainty to taxation system.\\n15.

CHALLENGES & FUTURE AHEAD:\\n16.1 Any new change is accompanied by difficulties and problems at the outset.\\nA change as comprehensive as GST is bound to pose certain challenges not only\\nfor the government but also for business community, tax administration and even\\ncommon citizens of the country. Some of these challenges relate to the\\nunfamiliarity with the new regime and IT systems, legal challenges, return filing\\nand reconciliations, passing on transition credit. Lack of robust IT infrastructure\\nand system delays makes compliance difficult for the taxpayers. Many of the\\nprocesses in the GST are new for small and medium enterprises in particular, who\\nwere not used to regular and online filing of returns and other formalities.\\n16.2 Based on the feedback received from businesses, consumers and taxpayers\\nfrom across the country, attempt has been made to incorporate suggestions and\\nreduce problems through short-term as well as long-term solutions. After rectifying\\nsystem glitches, E-way bill for inter-State movement of goods has been\\nsuccessfully implemented from 01-04-', 'As regards intra-State supplies, option\\nwas given to States to choose any date on or before 03-06-', 'All States have\\nnotified e-way bill rules for intra-State supplies last being NCT of Delhi where it\\nwas introduced w.e.f. 16-06-', 'A total of ', 'crore e-way bills for inter-State\\nmovement and 3.17 crore for intra-State movement have been generated till\\n31-05-', '\\n16.3 NAPA has initiated investigation into various complaints of anti-profiteering\\nand has passed orders in some cases to protect consumer interest.\\n16.4 To expedite sanction of refund, electronic filing of refunds, along with all\\nsupporting documents/invoices, has been enabled on the common portal.\\nClarificatory Circulars and notifications have been issued to guide field formations\\nof CBIC and States in this regard. The government has put in place an IT grievance\\nredressal mechanism to address the difficulties faced by taxpayers owing to\\ntechnical glitches on the GST portal.\\n16.5 The introduction of GST is truly a game changer for Indian economy as it\\nhas replaced multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple,\\ntransparent and technology–driven tax regime. It will integrate India into a single,\\ncommon market by breaking barriers to inter-State trade and commerce. By\\neliminating cascading of taxes and reducing transaction costs, it will enhance ease\\nof doing business in the country and provide an impetus to “Make in India”\\ncampaign. GST will result in “ONE NATION, ONE TAX, ONE MARKET”.\\n*****\\nNote: This write-up is for education purposes only\\n']\n"
